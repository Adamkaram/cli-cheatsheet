## CLI Design Thinking

- **12 Factor CLI Apps** ([Blogpost](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izx3-KSuaM8)): Jeff Dickey's list of requirements for UX.

- **Heroku CLI Style Guide** ([Guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cli-style-guide), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHiDG-_XoRk), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ud5MkVN_s)): Heroku's CLI Style Guide. 

- **CLI State Machines** ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/3af1e264b8460af8897768045b2c229f)): My little thoughts on state management
