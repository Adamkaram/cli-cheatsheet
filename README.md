# cli-cheatsheet
helpful libraries and resources for *building* Node.js CLIs. Not [a list of CLIs](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps).

## CLI Design Thinking

- **12 Factor CLI Apps** ([Blogpost](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izx3-KSuaM8)): Jeff Dickey's list of requirements for UX.

- **Heroku CLI Style Guide** ([Guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cli-style-guide), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHiDG-_XoRk), [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ud5MkVN_s)): Heroku's CLI Style Guide. 

- **CLI State Machines** ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/3af1e264b8460af8897768045b2c229f)): My little thoughts on state management
  
## Frameworks

- [**Commander**](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/): Built by TJ, used in `create-react-app`, `vue-cli`, and many others. Key feature: pluggability. [**Vorpal**](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) is another framework inspired by Commander and is seeking maintainers
- [**Oclif**](https://github.com/oclif/oclif): Built by Heroku, used in [Heroku](https://github.com/heroku/cli) and [Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) CLI's. Key feature: pluggability.
- [**Sade**](https://github.com/lukeed/sade): Built by lukeed, used in [tsdx](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx). Key feature: lightweight?
- [**Gluegun**](https://github.com/infinitered/gluegun): Built by Infinite Red, used in [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) and [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli). Key feature: templating/filesystem
- [**Ink**](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink): Built by Vadim & Sindre. Key Feature: React Components and Yoga Layout.
- [**Scritch**](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/scritch): Built by Jamie, used at Eventbrite. Key Feature: compose multiple scripts regardless of language into one CLI.
- [**Yargs**](https://github.com/yargs/yargs): Built by [bcoe](https://github.com/bcoe), used by `webpack-cli`, `mocha`, `react-native`, `nyc`, and 14,343 other modules.

## Utility Libraries

### Update Management/Nagging

- https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier#readme

### Context/Config

**Context from filesystem/PATH**

- https://github.com/npm/node-which Like running `which`: Find the first instance of an executable in the PATH.
- https://github.com/szwacz/fs-jetpack filesystem access
- https://github.com/sindresorhus/find-up search up the parents path for where files are located

**Loading/Storing config**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware of [the XDG spec](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). Sindre's libraries use [`env-paths`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-paths#pathsconfig) to get paths compliant with this.

- https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf simple config storing (maybe try [conf-cli](https://github.com/natzcam/conf-cli) to manipulate if needed) the successor to [configstore](https://github.com/sindresorhus/conf#how-is-this-different-from-configstore)
- https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig Find and load configuration from a package.json property, rc file, or CommonJS module. [Check `searchPaths` to implement XDG spec compliance.](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig/issues/152)
- https://github.com/jonschlinkert/data-store conf like datastore but in the shclinkerverse

### üåüInput

- https://npm.im/minimist

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your framework may come with parsing built in

### Command execution

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa

### Spinners

- https://npm.im/ora (recommended)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-ux#cliaction
- http://npm.im/log-update

### Templating

- https://github.com/amwmedia/plop
- Angular Schematics https://angular.io/guide/schematics
- Yeoman generator https://yeoman.io/

### üåüOutput

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-release-fetch (very low level pull from github)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è None of these are offline-first. Keen on finding one that respects offline first.

### Misc

- https://npm.im/stmux for `tmux` like UI
- https://npm.im/listr for progress lists
